# How to make money

---

# Premises

* having access to some money is useful
* business / money / exchange isn't inherently bad/wrong
* can still practise commons or unconditional sharing stuff _within_ groups
* the money/trade part is more an interface to the _other_ bit of the world
* not pure/ideological, pragmatic, with a twist of idealism
* some amount of economic freedom is desirable
* what is done with the money is mostly another topic
* working together is fun, and bonding

# Ways to get money

* get a job (short, or long)
* get a business
* own things that give you ongoing income
* invest
* accept random donations
* get funding
* convince/trick the state that you are in need of socialized support

---

# Problems

* lots of jobs / businesses are morally questionable
* money / capitalism can be like a vortex that draws you in
* doing small bits of work for money is annoying
* money worries suck
* people end up doing work they really don't want to
* adding money into a voluntary project might damage it
* the state can (and will) change it's rules
* funding applications / bureaucracy is painful
* dealing with money adds complexity (taxes, allocation, ..)
* investing is morally dubious (gambling)

- democratic co-operative - become part of it, participatory...
- non-consumerist / resilient / sustainable
